## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

### Security

## [1.1.0]

### Added

-   feat: exported `inject()` function from the public API via `index.ts`  
    The function is now available as part of the main module exports.

## [1.0.0]

### Added

-   feat: Enable native ESM support using `"type": "module"` and `moduleResolution: "NodeNext"` in the compiler settings.
-   feat: All internal imports now explicitly include `.js` extensions for full Node.js ESM compatibility.
-   feat: Updated `tsconfig.json` to reflect changes for ESM builds (`module: "NodeNext"`, `target: "ES2020"`, etc.).
-   feat(cli): add `--without-extension` (`-x`) flag to optionally omit file extensions in generated import paths
-   feat: introduce `inject()` function as a programmatic alternative to the `@Inject` decorator  
    Supports optional initializers and constructor instantiation for resolved dependencies.  
    Designed for cases where decorators are not suitable or dynamic resolution is needed.
-   test: added comprehensive test suite for `inject()` function, covering resolution, initialization, error cases and instantiation behavior

### Changed

-   All source files using relative or internal imports were updated to use `.js` extensions to support Node.js ESM runtime resolution.
-   test: update Jest config for ts-jest ESM compatibility and .js import support
-   renamed internal parameter `necessary` → `isNecessary` for naming clarity

### Removed

-   Removed implicit support for CommonJS-style imports without file extensions.

### Deprecated

-   Support for CommonJS consumers using `require()` is no longer available. Use `import` with an ESM-compatible environment instead.

### Fixed

### Security

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

-   **BREAKING CHANGE**: This version migrates the entire codebase to native ES modules.
    -   Consumers must use Node.js in ESM mode or compatible bundlers.
    -   Import paths now include `.js` extensions.
    -   Using `require()` (CommonJS) to load this library will no longer work.
    -   All consuming projects must either:
        -   Use `"type": "module"` in their `package.json`, or
        -   Use an ESM-aware bundler (e.g. Webpack, Vite, etc.)

## [0.4.0]

### Added

-   feat: Export ImplementsStatic helper function

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

### Security

## [0.3.0]

### Added

-   refactor: consolidate registration decorators
    Introduced Register decorator to handle class and instance registration in the DI container.
    Deprecated RegisterInstance in favor of Register, which now internally handles instance registration.
    Added support for marking dependencies as deprecated with a warning logged upon first resolution.
    Updated documentation with examples and notes on deprecation.
-   tests: add mode parameter to RegisterInstanceDecorator
    Introduced a mode parameter to the test_RegisterInstanceDecorator function allowing 'instance' or 'standalone' modes.
    Updated test cases to utilize the new mode parameter when registering an instance.
    Disabled specific ESLint rule in Decorators.test.ts for deprecation warnings.
    Added an additional test call to test_RegisterInstanceDecorator with 'instance' mode.
-   refactor: add region tags for overloads in Register.ts

## [0.2.0]

### Added

-   Add pre release building to release workflow on dev/\* branches an version changes.
-   feat: Introduced a new CLI command `tsinjex-generate` to automate the generation of import statements for registered dependencies.  
    The command scans `.ts` files for `@Register` and `@RegisterInstance` decorators and generates an `auto-imports.ts` file.  
    This ensures that all registered dependencies are automatically included without requiring manual imports.  
    The CLI can be executed via `npx tsinjex-generate` or added as a script in `package.json` for easier integration.

## [0.0.14]

### Added

-   Added **ChangeLog** file and format it according to [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
-   Added reference to **Semantic Versioning** in the changelog file. (History will be updated on time).
-   Version format is now `v0.0.0` instead of `0.0.0`. Changes to this are also reflected in the workflos.
-   Add `Identifiers` and `Jest` Sections to the `README.md` file.
-   feat: Add new Error `InitializationError` to reflect errors during initialization of a dependency.
-   feat: Add initialization error handling and refactor Inject.
-   feat: After injecting a dependency, the lazzy loading getter will be replaced with the dependency itself.
-   feat: remove the use of a private property to store the injected dependencies. Now the dependencies are stored in the property itself.
-   test: Add tests for the new features.
