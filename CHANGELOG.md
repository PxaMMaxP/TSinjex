## [0.2.0]

### Added

- Add pre release building to release workflow on dev/* branches an version changes.
- feat: Introduced a new CLI command `tsinjex-generate` to automate the generation of import statements for registered dependencies.  
  The command scans `.ts` files for `@Register` and `@RegisterInstance` decorators and generates an `auto-imports.ts` file.  
  This ensures that all registered dependencies are automatically included without requiring manual imports.  
  The CLI can be executed via `npx tsinjex-generate` or added as a script in `package.json` for easier integration.
